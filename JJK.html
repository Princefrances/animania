<p>Jujutsu Kaisen (呪術廻戦)[a] is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Gege Akutami. It has been serialized in Shueisha's shōnen manga magazine Weekly Shōnen Jump since March 2018, with its chapters collected and published in 22 tankōbon volumes as of March 2023. The story follows high school student Yuji Itadori as he joins a secret organization of Jujutsu Sorcerers to eliminate a powerful Curse named Ryomen Sukuna, of whom Yuji becomes the host. Jujutsu Kaisen is a sequel to Akutami's Tokyo Metropolitan Curse Technical School, serialized in Shueisha's Jump GIGA from April to July 2017, later collected in a tankōbon volume, retroactively titled as Jujutsu Kaisen 0, in December 2018.
<br><br>
In Jujutsu Kaisen, all living beings emanate energy called Cursed Energy (呪力, Juryoku), which arises from negative emotions that naturally flow throughout the body. Ordinary people cannot control this flow in their bodies. As a result, they continually lose Cursed Energy, resulting in the birth of Curses (呪い, Noroi), a race of spiritual beings whose primary desire is to bring harm to humanity. These curses are shown as gruesome monsters, ghosts, and yōkai.
<br><br>
Jujutsu Sorcerers (呪術師, Jujutsushi, lit. "Cursed Technique Masters" or "Shamans") are people who control the flow of Cursed Energy in their bodies, allowing them to use it as they please and also to reduce its release. High-ranking Sorcerers and Curses can refine this energy and use it to perform Cursed Techniques (呪術式, Jujutsushiki), which tend to be unique to the user or their family. An advanced form of Cursed Technique is Domain Expansion (領域展開, Ryōiki Tenkai), which the users build a pocket dimension of variable size. Inside the domain, all of their attacks will always connect and grow in strength.
<br><br>
Yuji Itadori is an unnaturally fit high school student living in Sendai. On his deathbed, his grandfather instils two powerful messages within Yuji: "always help others" and "die surrounded by people." Yuji's friends at the Occult Club attracted Curses to their school when they unsealed a rotten finger talisman which Yuji swallowed to protect Megumi Fushiguro and his friends, becoming host to a powerful Curse named Ryomen Sukuna. Due to Sukuna's evil nature, all sorcerers are required to exorcise him (and, by extension, Yuji) immediately. But upon seeing Yuji retaining control over his body, Megumi's teacher Satoru Gojo brings him to the Tokyo Prefectural Jujutsu High School with a proposal to his superiors: postpone Yuji's death sentence and train under Gojo until he consumes all of Sukuna's fingers so the Curse can be eliminated. At the same time, a group of cursed spirits plot a multi-layered attack on the world of jujutsu sorcery, including the Cursed Spirit Mahito and a corrupted sorcerer named Suguru Geto, who was executed by Gojo a year prior. The Kyoto school's principal wants Yuji dead immediately at the exchange event between the Tokyo and Kyoto jujutsu schools. In contrast, others, including fellow student Nobara Kugisaki, side with Gojo to keep Yuji alive.
<br><br>
After several missions, the disfigured Kyoto Jujutsu Tech second-year student Kokichi Muta, who controls the Cursed Corpse Mechamaru, is revealed to be a mole. After Muta swiftly betrays them, Mahito kills him. Geto and the cursed spirits lay a screen over Shibuya, and various sorcerers arrive at the scene to fight them. Gojo fights off cursed spirits and exorcises Hanami, a high-ranking cursed spirit, but is sealed away by Geto in a special artifact, while Nobara is killed by Mahito. The events also reveal that the current Geto is not the original but rather Geto's corpse possessed by an ancient sorcerer named Kenjaku. Yuji and his allies face Kenjaku's forces, with Gojo still trapped inside the artifact. As the incident ends, Kenjaku reveals that he has been jumping from body to body for thousands of years and implanting Binding Vows, which in turn awakens thousands of new sorcerers throughout Japan, including Tsumiki Fushiguro, Megumi's step-sister. He then unleashes a slew of curses on Japan, ushering in chaos and a world of cursed spirits reminiscent of the Heian period.
<br><br>
In the aftermath, Yuji and Megumi team up with second-year student Yuta Okkotsu and Yuki Tsukumo, a special grade jujutsu sorcerer and one of the most powerful sorcerers of all time, along with half-human, half-Curse Choso and second-year student Maki Zen'in to meet with Master Tengen, an immortal, part-Curse part-human jujutsu sorcerer. Tengen reveals Kenjaku's plan to merge the former's consciousness with Japan's human population. The Culling Game, Kenjaku's all-out war between the sorcerers and Curse users of Japan, then begins.
